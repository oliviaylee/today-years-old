There are no timeouts, substitutions, halftimes, or other breaks. Because of this, the sport requires extreme amounts of stamina and talent to play, and to be successful, it requires even more effort. Cross country consists of long races (minimum 5k or 3.1 miles) over varied terrains, including hills, roads, mud puddles, grassy fields, rocky paths, and sometimes even shallow streams. To complete the race, the runners must not only have the strength to finish, but must also be aware of their surroundings at all times. Stop paying attention to your surroundings, and you could fall, costing you valuable seconds, knocking you out of the race, or even sending you to the hospital. Cross country is not to be confused with indoor/outdoor track. Although they have long-distance events, their longest usually is 5k, cross country's shortest. Also, they have no hills or other obstacles; they just run around a track many times. Road races aren't technically true cross country races, but usually get grouped together with cross country races because of their distance and hills. A true cross country race stays away from pavement as much as possible.\r\nTo succeed in cross country, a couple things are neccessary. For one, you have to have a strong heart and put in lots of practice. If running 5+ miles a day doesn't sound like a good workout, you'd better try a less-taxing sport. Secondly, a good pair a racing and training shoes are a must. For racing, lightweight flats or spikes work well; the course determines which is the better choice. For best results, a pair of shoes with removable spikes works well. Training shoes should be sturdy and  durable; training shoes should not be your everyday sneakers. Buy another pair specifically for running. Just remember - don't wear training shoes during a race; although flats only cut off a few seconds each mile, over a, say 10 mile race, this can make a big difference. And before a race starts, always make sure your shoes are double-knotted. You don't want to run with untied shoes or have to tie them during a race. Also, always make sure your uniform/shirt is tucked in. This also shaves seconds off your time. Unless the temperature is below freezing, wear shorts when racing, again to get better times. If it is too cold, wear pants to prevent your legs from becoming too cold, thus preventing them from working at their best.\r\nCross country is cool in that it can be both an individual and team sport. Individuals compete against other runners and their own PRs (personal records) over the distance. The individual runners' scores are added up for a team score; the lower the score, the better.\r\nA lot of people criticize distance runners, especially sprinters. They make fun of us for wearing short shorts, they say our sport is primitive and requires no talent, ect. While it is true we don't have the same turnouts as football, baseball, or basketball games have, our small fan base is friendly. We don't have hecklers and brawls because our team lost. Our fans are civilized and respect the winning team and all athletes, regardless of their talent. I know this one runner whose extremely slow (10+ minute miles), and instead of taunting him, the fans wait for him to finish and treat him with respect.

Most of High school is not spent learning but involves trying to find friends who aren't complete douche bags, trying hook up with people of the opposite sex unsuccessfully, combing your hair, buying cloths in the effort that someone will notice you, working out so you will not get your ass kicked everyday, trying desperately to get rid of the zits that have taken over your face, driving a car that a homeless person wouldn't piss in or riding on an over crowed bus while choking on diesel fumes, while people you don't know make fun of you worse then your friends do, and on top of  all of that, you must act like nothing is wrong in your life.", "permalink": "http://high-school.urbanup.com/1084556", "thumbs_up": 20835, "author": "Jack", "word": "High School", "defid": 1084556, "current_vote": "", "example": "High school is a place where everyone acts like their lives are great but are really dead inside.\r\n\r\nThe scars of High School last long after graduation day.", "thumbs_down": 2036, "tags": ["school", "school", "college", "college", "middle school", "middle school", "freshman", "freshman", "hell", "hell"], "sounds": ["http://wav.urbandictionary.com/highschool-29127.wav", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/highschool-31061.wav", "http://api.twilio.com/2008-08-01/Accounts/ACd09691b82112e4b26fce156d7c01d0ed/Recordings/REded78f9cf5422d0f5f43468bb34c760e.mp3"], "lowercase_word": " high school"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "57283ad09e80afb8a5c93a69"}, "definition": "A sleazy sex move in which while the guy is taking the girl anally he punches her in the back of the head, making her ass or vagina contract.", "permalink": "http://donkey-punch.urbanup.com/1086622", "thumbs_up": 5975, "author": "Sheck", "word": "donkey punch", "defid": 1086622, "current_vote": "", "example": "Kevin donkey punched me.

Like everyone else, it all falls under personal preference. Sex is really such a personal and intimate act that no one answer would fit for everyone, but here are a few particulars to consider ... \r\n\r\nBODIES. We sometimes forget that the entire body is an erogenous zone. Sensitive areas include the face, ears, neck, arms, chest, belly, back, butt, and thighs, back of knees, calves, feet and toes. The entire body can be used to excite a woman. Rubbing bodies together, feeling erect nipples or moist pubic area can excite with subtle motions. \r\n\r\nFINGERS. Fingers can be delightful to use on those women who enjoy penetration (not all women do). Some women appreciate long, thin fingers while others like the feel of short, strong fingers. No matter what the preference, all women appreciate clean, short, well-filed nails. \r\n\r\nHANDS. Running hands up and down a lover's body will often elicit electric responses of passion. From light caresses down the back to deep rubbing across the butt, caressing is an important aspect to sex. Caressing often turns to gentle pinching or tugging at nipples. Lightly running fingers in a tickling motion across the belly and sides will excite many women. Once excitement has built, slipping fingers into the vagina or rubbing against the clitoris will often bring a woman to orgasm. \r\n\r\nMOUTH. Kissing is a good place to begin and a very important part of sex. Kisses come in different styles depending on the person, the mood and the moment. Tiny, soft kisses tantalize and intrigue. Deep, open-mouth kisses with tongues entwined convey a depth of passion and longing. Kisses are appropriate for any part of the body, wherever one feels the urge to place them, lightly or with trailing tongues. Gently nibbling or sucking on nipples excites some women, and some women can reach orgasm just from breast arousal. It is important to note reactions to these stimulations as some women dislike having their breasts touched at all. Gently nibbling or sucking on a responsive clitoris is enjoyed by most women and most often results in orgasm.\r\n\r\nPELVIC AREA. Some women can reach orgasm by rubbing pelvic areas together or against a lover's leg. This can be done with one partner on top or two women side-to-side.\r\n\r\nANAL SEX. Anal sex can include anilingus (licking the anus) and/or penetration. Penetration can be done with a finger or fingers, dildo or butt plug. Some women love anal sex, others do not. Like everything else, it's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nDILDOS, VIBRATORS & BUTT PLUGS. (Or objects used to vaginal or anal penetration). Some women use dildos and/or butt plugs some do not. Some use them occasionally; some use them all the time. Dildos come in many different shapes, colors and sizes. Some are shaped as corncobs, fists, dolphins or fingers. Some have attachments to stimulate the clitoris during penetration and some have two ends to stimulate two women at one time. It's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nFISTING. Fisting is penetrating a woman's vagina with your entire hand. Fisting requires a lot of concentration and caution. I recommend Hand In The Bush: The Fine Art of Vaginal Fisting, by Deborah Addington, if you want to learn the proper how-to on fisting. \r\n\r\nMUTUAL MASTURBATION. Many women enjoy mutual masturbation. Lying while facing each other, simultaneously rubbing and touching each other's clitoris can be educational as well as enjoyable.", "permalink": "http://lesbian-sex.urbanup.com/1352605", "thumbs_up": 5149, "author": "sweetie2010", "word": "lesbian sex", "defid": 1352605, "current_vote": "", "example": "The two chicks had hot lesbian sex all night using dildos, fingers, mouth, n toys", "thumbs_down": 2756, "tags": ["lesbian", "sex", "scissoring", "lesbians", "dildo", "dyke", "pussy", "gay", "oral sex", "girl on girl"], "sounds": [], "lowercase_word": " lesbian sex"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "572b2234251fff72d029c084"}, "definition": "A very enjoyable part of love-making, in which the mouth, lips and tongue are used to stimulate a partner's genitals. Technically it relates to the act between any permutation of the sexes, but it is most commonly used to refer to a woman going down on a man.\r\n\r\nOral sex is particularly effective (for both sexes) if the woman kneels in front of the man, which puts her at the perfect height to take his swollen cock in her mouth. She can then lick, kiss, suck and generally adore his cock and balls with her mouth until her partner is stimulated to the point of ejaculation, whereupon she can (and ideally should) swallow his sperm. Women who dislike the taste of semen and who can [deep throat] may prefer to let their partner shoot down their throat to avoid the taste buds altogether.\r\n\r\nA talented [cocksucker] can bring a man off from erection to orgasm with her mouth alone, but a light wanking action on the base of the cock can be productive. Some men will grip the woman's hair or head, either to encourage more action or to hold the head still while they thrust urgently into the woman's mouth in a vigorous fucking action. This can cause the woman to gag but should be tolerated if possible as it usually means an orgasm is close.\r\n\r\nOral sex can be performed simultaneously, when it is often referred to as [69]-ing.\r\n\r\nOral sex doesn't have to progress to ejaculation, but can also be an extremely pleasant form of foreplay. Waking up a sleeping lover by sucking his cock gently to produce an erection is a particularly nice form of oral sex. Once a woman gets the taste for spunk, however, it can be difficult to resist the temptation to suck her lover all the way to climax in the desire to get a delicious mouthful.

The nice guy would never capitalize on a vulnerable girl, objectify or cheat on a girl, he will go out of his way and bend over backwards to help his \u201cfriends\u201d and will never ask for anything in return but no matter how intelligent, understanding, humorous, compassionate, trusting or loyal the nice guy is the female cohort will always pass him up and endure any length of abuse, objectification, apathy and cold-heartedness from a man if he has physical attractiveness, fashion, big muscles and chiseled facial features.\r\n\r\n The nice guy will eventually realize that his dependability and empathy will never be appreciated and all his friendships with females are all one-sided.  This coupled with years of watching girls go for tanned, muscular jerk-offs with nice cars while he desperately hopes someone will realize that how viable he actually is will spawn and incubate the nice guy\u2019s insecurities and he will eventually abandon his views, dumb-down his speech, take-up weight-lifting and switch majors from cancer research with a minor in theoretical physics to playground management so he can devote his time to emulating Baywatch characters and football players so that he will one day be viewed as more than a \u201cnice guy.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe nice guy will eventually work up the courage to ask out his attractive female friend but will invariably be turned down because she\u2019s so self-centered that she\u2019d never actually had a smidgeon of compassion for the nice guy\u2019s feelings or even realized that he\u2019s interested in girls.  After rejecting the nice guy, the girl will downplay the supposed friendship to the point where they never speak again, which in turn will make the nice guy depressed (ironically, he won\u2019t have anyone to talk to) because he\u2019s devoted so much time and energy and has become so warped from being exposed to these kinds of people that he will either live the rest of his life alone in a tiny apartment, jerking off to old Saved by the Bell episodes or get drunk one night and impregnate a 300-pound, cross-eyed derelict who works at Wendy\u2019s and spend the rest of his life being treated like shit.  \r\n\r\nThe whole \u2018nice guy\u2019 phenomenon really supports the idea that people primarily care about physical appearances and that shrewdness, selfishness and narcissism will always triumph over compassion, rapport and \u201cinner beauty.\u201d     \r\n", "permalink": "http://nice-guy.urbanup.com/1466370", "thumbs_up": 6074, "author": "desperryado", "word": "nice guy", "defid": 1466370, "current_vote": "", "example": "\"Jeez Patrick, I hope I can find a nice guy like you someday.\" \r\n\r\n\"Well, if you need me I'll be at home, crying myself to sleep while masturbating to the sound of my 70-year-old neighbors having sex...I might also play some ps2.\"", "thumbs_down": 1977, "tags": ["jerk", "asshole", "friend zone", "loser", "friendzone", "nice guys", "nice", "friend", "just friends", "guy"], "sounds": [], "lowercase_word": " nice guy"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "572b343b251fff72d02a6bd0"}, "definition": "A board, or piece of wood or metal, having one edge perfectly straight, used to ascertain whether a line is straight or a surface even, and for drawing straight lines.", "permalink": "http://straight-edge.urbanup.com/1481449", "thumbs_up": 5457, "author": "Brian Y.", "word": "straight edge", "defid": 1481449, "current_vote": "", "example": "\"Are you straight edge?\"\r\n\"Did you just call me a fucking ruler?\"", "thumbs_down": 1886, "tags": ["hardcore", "sxe", "emo", "edge", "scene", "xxx", "hxc", "drugs", "punk", "straightedge"], "sounds": ["http://media.urbandictionary.com/sound/straightedge-16446.mp3", "http://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACd09691b82112e4b26fce156d7c01d0ed/Recordings/RE518942d1fec6794a422b0a789fae4ef5.mp3", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/straightedge-36419.wav"], "lowercase_word": " straight edge"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "572b3536251fff72d02a744d"}, "definition": "When the garbage gets piled so high that you and your roommates carefully place trash on top to form a tower.

That shit is now France.\r\n\r\nInstead of having a cigarette after sex, Chuck Norris heads outside and brands his cattle.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris doesn't break up with his girlfriends... He punches them in the vagina and they leave.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris had sex with a cigarette machine.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris once ate an entire watermelon, including the seeds, then grew an entire watermelon patch in his stomach which fed eleven families for six weeks.\r\n\r\nIn ancient China there is a legend that one day a child will be born from a dragon and vanquish evil from the land. That man is not Chuck Norris, because Chuck killed that man.\r\n\r\nIf you were to know Chuck Norris' true name, your mind would collapse upon itself.\r\n\r\nA freak accident involving Chuck Norris and a severe thunderstorm turned an ordinary Total Gym (R) into Richard Dean Anderson, star of TV series \"MacGyver\". Scholars around the world maintain that this is the only known case of irony that is both situational and dramatic.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, Chuck Norris is unable to send his roundhouse kicks across the fabric of time, however he IS able to perform this action across parallel dimentions and once, just for fun, roundhouse kicked his own ass.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris broke his own leg, purely for the sake of winning the special olympics.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris once went to a frat party, and proceeded to roundhouse every popped collar in sight. He then drank three kegs and shit on their floor, just because he's Chuck Norris.\r\n\r\nDon't say anything bad about Chuck Norris if you're near a lake, river, pond or marsh; otherwise he will come up out of the water with his AK-47 already firing.\r\n\r\nUpon reading a fictitious story in his local tabloid, Chuck Norris ripped out the heart of its writer and used his blood to fertilize his lawn. To celebrate, Norris let Steven Seagal out of his cage and beat him mercilessly. Mr. T, who was also present, pitied the shit out of Segal. Norris then fucked your wife, and lit her body on fire using pure grain alcohol and bolts of lightning from his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen Neil Armstrong uttered \"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" on the moon in 1969, he failed to notice Chuck Norris sitting behind him in a lawnchair, a beer in hand, until Chuck Norris gave Armstrong a swift roundhouse kick to the face. Armstrong never returned.\r\n\r\nThere is a secret plot to clone the greatest Hollywood action movie stars in order to create an unbeatable army. The people behind this plot only need very small samples of DNA to work with. This is why so many action stars have very short haircuts, and some even go to the extent of shaving their heads to prevent the evil fiends from getting such a sample. Chuck Norris is the only one with the balls not only to grow his hair long, but also to cultivate facial hair. When he's feeling particularly cocky, he sends his toenail clippings to the evil syndicate's headquarters with a note: \"Just try it, bitches, and I'll kick your asses into next Thursday.\"\r\n\r\nChuck Norris occasionally has Missing In Action flashbacks where he's escaping a Vietnam Prison and randomly starts killing Asians with his bare fist because thats the way Chuck rolls. You'll know when it's coming because Asians start flying through the air with random explosions, horrible subtitles will scroll your line of vision, and Chuck will run and hide in your mom's garden, finally stealing your Kia Sportage screaming, \"Get in the Chopper\" and lines like, \"I'm Proud to be a Fucking American\" after kicking your little sister in the face\r\n", "permalink": "http://chuck-norris.urbanup.com/1521056", "thumbs_up": 16524, "author": "Tony Mack", "word": "chuck norris", "defid": 1521056, "current_vote": "", "example": "Chuck Norris dropped that Asian with a boot to the skull!", "thumbs_down": 10596, "tags": ["awesome", "chuck", "norris", "god", "badass", "jesus", "sex", "bruce lee", "amazing", "cool"], "sounds": ["http://wav.urbandictionary.com/chucknorris-20996.wav", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/chucknorris-21101.wav", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/chucknorris-21102.wav", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/chucknorris-21103.wav", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/chucknorris-21104.wav", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/chucknorris-21105.wav", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/chucknorris-26605.wav"], "lowercase_word": " chuck norris"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "572b3aaf251fff72d02aa08e"}, "definition": "The day after Thanksgiving, when stores decide to open at the asscrack of dawn to start Christmas sales.

Not that this should come as a newsflash to anyone who has ever listened to his music.  West\u2019s new album Late Registration just debuted at number one on the billboard charts, selling 860,000 copies in its first week. But the press has largely given the hip hop star a pass for his outrageous comments during an NBC telethon for Hurricane Katrina victims. As most Americans now know, the hugely successful rapper claimed that the government was sending troops to New Orleans not to help those in need but to \u201cshoot us\u201d and accused President Bush of not caring about blacks.  But the fact that West is himself a racist must not be overlooked, or, as is the case with the mainstream media, completely ignored.\r\n\r\nYou won\u2019t find any criticism of West on MTV, which has aired numerous documentaries in the past attacking hate speech, including questioning white rapper Eminem\u2019s anti-homosexual lyrics. But MTV and other outlets apparently have no problem with West\u2019s referring to whites as \u201cthe devil\u201d or his claim that when a drug dealer buys Jordans and a \u201ccrack head buy crack\u2026the white man get paid.\u201d  Funny, I don\u2019t recall getting any royalty checks from local crack sales last month.\r\n\r\nIn a hit song off West\u2019s new album, he degrades a black man who leaves his woman for \u201ca white girl.\u201d  And in a recent interview with Stuff Magazine, West said he doesn\u2019t believe white people should be \"allowed to use slang until it is at least a year old.\u201d  Say what? Seventy percent of hip hop albums are bought by whites. But apparently West believes the majority of his fans shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sing along to his tunes.\r\n\r\nRacial demagogues like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have always had a public forum.  Their bigoted records are somehow irrelevant to the reporters assigned to cover them. Jackson compared the scene at the New Orleans Superdome to that of a \u201chull of a slave ship\u201d and his comment went almost completely unchallenged in the press. There is something fundamentally wrong with how nearly all of the media ignores comments like these. The Kanye West example shows us what we already know, that if you are black and famous you have a license to say anything you want and you will never be held accountable for it.\r\n\r\nDuring his bumbling rant on NBC, West actually called himself a hypocrite for complaining and said he went \u201cshopping before giving a donation.\u201d While NBC did attempt to disassociate itself from West\u2019s assertion that the president of the United States does not care about black people, no one has bothered to ask the question of why Kanye West was invited on an NBC telethon to begin with. When a major television network gives a platform to someone who has made a career out of rapping about the evils of white people, no one should be surprised when he uses that opportunity to spew more of his pitiful ignorance.\r\n\r\nWest, the son of a Black Panther, is never criticized about his racist lyrics by any of the outlets that have helped make him famous. Silent on the issue are MTV, BET, hip hop radio stations, and even Time Magazine, whose recent cover story proclaimed West \u201cthe smartest man in pop music.\u201d  I can assure those at Time that Britney Spears, everyone\u2019s favorite pop music airhead, knows more about the world than Kanye West. At least she likely doesn\u2019t believe that \u201cAIDS was a man made disease placed in Africa just like crack was placed in the black community to break up the Black Panther party,\u201d as West told his fans during the Live 8 concerts this summer. \r\n\r\nThe double standard is understood throughout the country. When a famous white man says something racially insensitive, he is roundly criticized by all. And rightly so. There is absolutely no place for racism in society today. But when a famous black does the same, it\u2019s acceptable. Racism should never be tolerated, whether you are a U.S. Senator or a rap star. Trent Lott knows this. As do David Duke, Jimmy the Greek, and John Rocker. They all found out the hard way. And Kanye West is no better. He should be held to the same standards they have been held to.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time Americans treated black racism no different than white racism. There is simply no justification for either. So when a rapper preaches about the evils of white people, it\u2019s time for us to cut his mic. \r\n\r\nRudy Gersten is Director of Operations at the Center for Equal Opportunity.", "permalink": "http://kanye-west.urbanup.com/2277993", "thumbs_up": 5444, "author": "Nemesis", "word": "kanye west", "defid": 2277993, "current_vote": "", "example": "Yes just another example of how its fine to be racist if u are Black.\r\n\r\nKanye West: \" Yo it is the White Man who made Aids to kill off us Black People \" everyone cheers (including dumbed down sheep White People).", "thumbs_down": 3080, "tags": ["kanye", "taylor swift", "west", "rap", "douchebag", "jay-z", "asshole", "rapper", "gay", "beyonce"], "sounds": ["http://media.urbandictionary.com/sound/kanyewest-7702.mp3", "http://wav.urbandictionary.com/kanyewest-26500.wav"], "lowercase_word": " kanye west"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "572bc144251fff72d02eb90f"}, "definition": "A recently created and already widely known.

At the time, we were merely kids. I was 15 and she was 14. At the time, we had known eachother for about two or three years. We even dated for eight months during the sixth grade. But during those eight months we never made love. Now every once in a while she would let me touch her, but no sex of any kind And she had the most amazing body in the whole school. And by Spring Break of '98 we were in the eighth grade and she had the most amazing body in the entire class. Smooth curves. G sized breasts. Long, brown hair with brown eyes. She was what made all the guys drop their tongues to the floor and run to the end of their chains and start barkin' like the horny dogs they were. Including me. I, too, long desired to ravish her body like an animal. But I didn't want to violate her by just asking her like a dick. And I thought she'd never sleep with me because she only saw me as a 'friend'.\r\nSo during that Spring Break I woke up one morning, and walked into the kitchen to sneek some coffee into my bedroom because my dad never wanted me to drink it, thinking I was too young. But as I reached up in the cabinet to grab a mug, the phone rang. Naturally, I answered it since I was the one closest to it and my dad was sitting in the living room watching the weather reports as he usually did.\r\n\"Hello?\" I asked the person on the other line.\r\n\"Hey, there.\" it was Hannah. She spoke in an unusually sly voice. \"Hey, my parents just bought me a VCR and rented an ass-load of movies for me to watch while they're vacationing to Mexico for a couple of weeks to celebrate their 19th wedding annaversary. And I was wondering if you wanted to spend the night and watch a few with me?\" she explained.\r\n\"...What?...\" I was a bit confused. Why would she want me to spend the night, I thought.\r\n\"I just thought it would be... fun.\"\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I guess it does sound fun, 'cause I got nothing going on today. Hold on, let me ask my dad.\"\r\n\"Kay.\"\r\nI sat the phone down on the kitchen counter and walked into the living room to find my dad staring blankly at the tv. \"Hey, Dad? Is it alright if I spend the night over at a friend's house?\" I asked him.\r\nHis face slowly turned to me. \"The fuck?! You're a man for Christ's sake! Men don't have slumber parties!\"\r\n\"Dad, it's not what you think, it's over at Hann-\"\r\n\"Fine! Just go ya queer!\" he interrupted. There really was no point in explaining things to my father. He was just a narrow minded person.\r\nSo I walked back into the kitchen and picked up the phone, \"Yeah, my dad doesn't have a problem with it at all.\"\r\n\"Alright, great! Well get over here pronto!\"\r\n\"But it's morning?\" I was getting a bit confussed because A) she never asked me to come over for a sleep-over. And B) something in her voice didn't sound normal, she seemed like she was sorta flirty, but I didn't believe it. So I just shrugged it off.\r\n\"So? We'll still have some fun.\" she giggled.\r\n\"Fine. Be there in an hour.\" I sighed and hung up.\r\nI went into the bathroom to \"shit, shower, and shampoo\" as my dad always put it. I then packed the bookbag I used for school, and walked out the door.\r\nHannah and I both lived way out West of the outskirts of Richmond. And we lived about a mile away from eachother, so I just rode my old bike to her place. And it took only twenty minutes to get there.\r\nHer home was rather large and elegant (her father owned a hospital in Petersburg and could afford the American Dream for him and his family) and was located in the boonies with only the common rolling hills of Virginia that surrounded her freakishly huge house. Upon my arrival, I found her sitting out on her front porch, resting her head on her hand and crossing her legs and smiling at me in a way that she never had before, not even when we were going out. It was a very warm but very seductive smile. But what dealt stood out was that she was wearing a black bikini. I was on the verge of getting a hard-on.\r\nI glided my bike onto her front yard and just let it drop to the ground when I got off, like what most guys just do.\r\nWithout saying a word, Hannah got up and walked over to me and hugged me. But she did it in an intimate fashion. Her hands crept across my hips and slowly up my back, and gradually pressed her large breasts against my chest. That's when I felt my dick getting harder by the second. I was beginning to get a little suspicious, but kept putting it off.\r\nAnd in her sly tone she said, \"Hey, you!\"\r\n\"Uh... hey.\" I replied. She held on for another ten, long, and akward seconds. And my dick just kept getting harder and my heart was pounding and racing. It may have been akward, but it was still hot as hell.\r\n\"Come on inside... I have something to show you.\" she spoke softly. She led me in her house. It was a bit dark inside with a few boxes full of videos and the new VCR benieth the tv. She continued leading the way. I began to smell the scent of a fresh paint job and brand new drywall along with other scents that signaled previous construction. Finally she spoke in a normal tone, \"So my dad put in an extention to the house, so he could have this...\" she opened the door and flipped on the light inside the new room. It was her father's personal indoor swimming pool as I later found out that Hannah had stolen the key to the pool.\r\nShe looked over her shoulder at me with her seductive smile once again.\r\n\"So you brought me here just so we can swim all day? I got out at ten o'clock in the morning to swim? Are you fucking me?\" I bitched.\r\nShe turned her head back aroun and faced the ground and she whispered something. It took me a while to realize that what she just whispered was, \"Not yet...\". But I thought she was just joking, but it never left my mind. She began walking along the edge of the pool, and I watch her beautiful hips and ass sway with the rhythm of her footsteps. It made my heart sink. So I naturally followed her, as if I were under her spell, and I could not help myself but to be near her. She stopped and faced the pool, then looked back over her shoulder at me and leaned toward the pool and fell in.\r\n\"Uh, since you didn't tell me anything about swimming, I didn't bring my trunks.\"\r\nHannah responded quietly, \"It's okay. See that switch over there? Turn it off.\" she was speaking of the light switch. And without any slight thought of disobedience I did what she told me to do.\r\nThe room was pitch black. \"Great. I can't see.\" I began inching my way toward the pool when I heard Hannah fling something wet in front of me. I bent down to where I heard it land and felt it to find out what it was. It was the top piece of her bikini. And shortly thereafter, her bottom piece followed. It was now becoming clear to me that this could be the day I had long waited for.\r\nIn response, I began to strip naked as well. I slowly walked toward until I felt the edge of the pool. Instead of diving in, I just \"slipped\" in because I couldn't see where Hannah was and I didn't want to ruin my long desired wish by diving ON her.\r\nI heard her swim toward my direction, then I felt her hands on my waist. We stopped and floated there. It was then that it was inevitable that her and I were going to take eachother's virginity.\r\nMy head moved in closer to hers until my nose touched her face, then I began to passionately kiss her. Her body pressed against mine and I could feel her nipples on my chest. And her legs wrapped themselves around my waist. I needed her. I had so much energy bottled up inside me for the past two years, and it needed to be released inside of her.\r\nWe quickly began to French kiss, my tongue eating away inside her mouth. And I became bigger than ever. The head of my dick stroked her cunt to let her know that I would shortly penetrate.\r\nHannah stopped kissing me and whispered, \"No. Not just yet. Let's do a little more foreplay before we fuck.\" and we continued Frenching. I couldn't wait any longer. But I knew foreplay was better than nothing.\r\nSo my hands went lower into the water until they reached her perfect ass. They opened her cheeks and my two index fingers gently stroked her hole. That's when her breathing became uneven.\r\nShe leaned back into my right arm. This meant that she wanted me to move my left hand around and pleasure her pussy. And this I did. We stopped kissing and my left hand swept to her vagina and I immediately felt a slimy lining of cum around her groin. My index and middle finger proceeded and dug in her. Her legs began to squirm and her hip moved up and down as she moaned. We did this for five minutes before I moved on to her breasts.\r\nI lifted her up, pressed her against the side of the pool with my front against her back. I massaged her breasts and rolled her nipples. She was then gasping and moaning.\n\nAfter five minutes, she told me she was ready. I turned her body around and leveled my shaft, and steadily made my first thrust into her. It was magic. I never felt something so intese for a girl as I did that moment. She sounded a loud inhale. \"Are you alright?\" I asked.\r\n\"Never been better.\" I heard her breathe. I gave her another kiss on the lips and continued pumping her.\r\nWhen we were seven minutes into it, she started gasping my name, \"Jason! Jason! Oh, Jason! Harder! Harder! Faster! Faster, please!\" we were both about to cum, but I remembered that I wasn't wearing protection.\n\nSo I pulled out of her warm, pulsing vagina and turned her around again, and pulled her up so that she was bending over the edge. I raised myself on top of her with both our legs still in the water. I then whispered into her ear, \"This may hurt a bit. But I love you so much that I'm going to start off slowly.\"\r\n\"I love you, too.\" she whispered back over her shoulder. Her body began to shiver, and I knew she knew what I was about to do. So I lifted my right hand out of the water and held hers.\r\n\"Are you ready, baby girl?\" I asked.\r\n\"I trust you, so yes... I am.\"\r\nHer muscles relaxed, but she still shivered. I then took my rod and very slowly slid it in her asshole. When my head penetrated, she gave off a sharp and intense gasp, and she squeezed my hand very tightly. I slowly pushed it all the way in her. \"Baby, I think it's too big!\"\r\n\"Shh... just relax. I know it hurts, but it will get better. I promise.\" I assured her.\n\n\"Okay...\" Hannah replied.\r\nI pulled back slowly and pushed back in. I started off slow and as soon as I heard her moaning and gasping again I thrusted faster and harder.\n\nIt wasn't long before she began her orgasm. She was screaming with intense pleasure. And our legs were splashing in the water. I used me left hand to finger her pussy to add to her ecstacy. \"OH, GOD!!! YES!!! JASON!!! JASON!!! UGH!!! FUCK ME!!! YES!!! YES!!! YES!!!\r\nOH MY!!! YES!!! UGH MY ASS!!!\" her screams echoed off the walls of the pool room. And with the last few thrusts, I shot about eight shots of cum deep in her rectum. Neither of us could move. I remained in her because I was too weak.\n\nAfter ten minutes we kissed softly with what energy we did have. The area smelled intoxicating. The musk was thick with all sorts of unearthly scents. It was the smell of love.\r\nWe rested for thirty minutes on the side of the pool I silence. Then we both got up and tried to find our way through the darkness. I stumbled a few times as I held Hannah's hand, which made her laugh. We eventually found the light switch and I flipped it on.\r\nI looked at Hannah and she couldn't look more beautiful as she was completely naked. Her bare breasts were soft, perky, and perfect. And she was soaking wet from her waist to her knees.\r\nShe walked closer to me and we both sat up against the wall, and just kissed and cuddled. After that, we were both ready to go at it again, so we left our clothes in the pool to and rushed up to her room and we made love all day, all night, and all morning the next day before I left for home.\r\nTo this day, eleven years later, I never found out what got into her that day. But whatever it was, it blessed us to fall in love, and eventually we married. Well that's my sex story.

She will eventually be embroiled in some sort of scandal as she is actually bat-shit crazy in reality, and her career will come spiraling down into oblivion.
